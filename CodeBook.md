The raw data sets from the experiment were merged2. The raw data set was filtered to contain only mean and standard deviation signal variables3. Summarised average values were calculated for each mean and standard deviation variable over the activity and subject of each observation- this was performed by reshaping the data set via the following steps:I) melting the data set based on the mean and std deviation variablesii) casting this "melted" data set into a summarised tidy data frame
